# TowerOfHanoi
This project features a C++ implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using a stack-based approach. The program allows users to input the number of disks and manually enter disk numbers, solving the puzzle step by step using recursive logic. The code has a clear structure, utilizing the Stack class to manage the disk movements.
Key Features:
Stack Data Structure: The Stack class handles the disk operations using methods like push, pop, and Get_Top.
Recursive Logic: Implements the Tower of Hanoi solution without using traditional recursion, instead opting for iterative moves using stacks.
User Input: Allows the user to input disk numbers manually.
Console Output: Clearly shows each move of the disk from one rod to another.
